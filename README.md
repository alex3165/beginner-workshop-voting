# React Vote workshop
This Workshop will hopefully teach you the fundamentals of using React.
The goal today is to fill the gaps of this boilerplate. It's a simple voting app with a remote API.
The only thing we ask of you is to have fun and try to stick to functional programming as much as you can.

## Get started
Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Run the project:
```
npm start
```

## Proceeding with your solution
- Look at the result [here](http://workshop.alexrieux.fr)
- Search for `TODO: ` in the app to get some hint on how to proceed

- Basically you need to fetch the data from the [todo api](http://api.alexrieux.fr) add them to the redux store and display the results using [react victory](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-bar)

## You are stuck?
Have a look at the `solution` branch of the repository

## The API
Access [http://api.alexrieux.fr](http://api.alexrieux.fr) for the documentation,
although the comments should provide you enough hints.

## It is too easy...
- Voting workshop using redux-observable and websocket: [here](https://github.com/reactivate-ldn/advanced-polls-workshop)
- Meh I know Observable... well you can give it a try with Elm: [here](https://github.com/reactivate-ldn/elm-workshop-voting)
